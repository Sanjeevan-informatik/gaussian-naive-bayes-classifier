1.this  Naive Bayes Classifier was develop from scratct to undertand how gaussian naive Bayes Classifier work

2.we used the cleveland database to understand the performance of the algorithm

#What is Naive Bayes Classifier ?

Naive Bayes Classifiers are developed with the help Bayes Theorem.These classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature.

p(class∣data)=p(data∣class)∗p(class)/p(data)

where:

    class is a particular class (e.g. diease)
    data is an observation’s data
    p(class∣data) is called the posterior
    p(data|class) is called the likelihood
    p(class) is called the prior
    p(data) is called the marginal probability

#Gaussian Naive Bayes

Gaussian Naive Bayes is used when the features are continuous variables, and it assumes that the features follow a Gaussian distribution
